# bot:cringe
 the ultimate discord bot of cringe written with lowdb and discord.js

## Running the bot
_this bot runs on nodeJS and as such node and npm must all be installed and up to date to proceeed. Git is also required_

**1)** Start by cloning this repository onto your computer with `git clone https://github.com/TateB/cringebot/`

**2)** Navigate to the downloaded folder with `cd cringebot`

**3)** Next, install all relevant dependencies with `npm install`

**4)** Then create your Discord server. Make sure it has a dedicated channel for the following:

- Bot commands
- level ups
- music 
- rules
- roles (optional)

Also make sure that the #rules (and #roles) channel have at least one message in it. (this could be the list of server rules for example)

Make sure your server has a baseline role all members will have, should they agree to the rules.

**5)** Finally, create  a file called `config.json` in the same directory as the bot.
This file will contain all the relevant server and connection details, it should look something like this:
```javascript
{
	"prefix": "!",
	"token": "tokenHere",
	"alias": {
		"serverID": "",
		"channels": {
			"botCommands": "",
			"levelUps": "",
			"music": "",
			"rules": "",
			"roles": ""
		},
		"messages": {
			"rulesAccept": "",
			"customRoles": ""
		},
		"roles": {
			"member": "",
			"custom": {
				"customOne": {
					"id": "",
					"emoji": ""
				}, 
				"customTwo": {
					"id": "",
					"emoji": ""
				},
	                 "pronouns": {
		                "he": "",
		                "him": "",
                  		"she": "",
	                 	"her": "",
		                "they": "",
                		"them": "",
	                   	"any": "",
	                       	"all": ""
	                       	
			}
		}
	}
}
```
You will have to populate the values of each field yourself.
- `serverID` - the id of your discord server, you can get this by right clicking the server icon and clicking "Copy ID"
- `channels` - These correspond to the ID of the listed text channels. You can also get these by right clicking the channel name and clicking "Copy ID". _Note that you do not need individual channels for each, you can put them all in the same channel if you wish. However #music needs to be a separate, standalone channel._
- `messages` - These are the messages that the bot will then attach reacts to. The messages have to be in the rules and roles channel respectively.
- `roles.member` = this is the default role that all members of the server will receive upon accepting the rules (by reacting to `rulesAcceptMessage`)
- `custom` = these are the role ids and emojis you can specify for members to receive by reacting to `messages.customRoles`, you have infinite customisability and can add as many roles as you want to this, not just the amount that are listed.
- `pronouns` = These are the role IDs used for the pronouns of each member. These are not optional

**Tip: if you do not want to use one of the optional values, just put the word `null` as the value, as demonstrated above**
